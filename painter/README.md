# Painter app with Vanilla JS
## Primary Goal
Wanted to have basic drawing function and reset for clear the canvas and if things are smoothly working, also wanted to add the color options.
### Using Canvas API
Still wondering the clearing function(reset button) could be in other way - like declaring width value again.
  But so far as I tried, clearRect and beginPath are working the best for now.
